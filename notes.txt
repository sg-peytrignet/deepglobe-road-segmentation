Maybe some repetition in the config class, and some parameters not used
Also create a test set for prediction
What is in the pre-processing function? Does it resize to a target size?
create multiple modules to store different functions
round_clip_0_1 and kwargs - does it make sense?
does the padding and cropping also resize? what's the target?
what does a generator do exactly?
what size image is actually required by the model? check augmentation, pre-processing functions to see what they do and why...
